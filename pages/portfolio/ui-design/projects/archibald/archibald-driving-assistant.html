      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>
        The ideation process persists during the whole project idea development. Starting as a simple discussion with a fellow driving student, it became a conversational topic with more people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The discussion evolved from a simple chat to empathy on what the learning process for different people was, what was their experience, what were their difficulties... And it ended as an abstract idea of a tool that covers if not all, at least most of the pain points in the driving learning process.

      <div>
        <h5>Web Research and Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Based on web research, I made a Competitive Analysis on six tools similar to the Archibald concept.</strong> The analysis shows that most of the analyzed tools share similar functionalities like bookings, automatic reminders, integrated in-app payments, user roles, scheduling options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>However, not one of them provides the core functionalities, on which the whole idea of Archibald is based</strong> - to be used not only for organizing the process but to offer a variety of resources aiming to improve the quality of the driving lessons and their outcome.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h5>Initial Users Survey</h5>
        <p>
          To validate my assumptions on the potential users' preferences, their overall opinion of such tools, and if they would qualify them as useful, I made a short initial survey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey consists of eleven multiple answers questions related to the product and one open-ended question for users' feedback on the questionnaire.

              <li>The bigger part of the survey participants can not spare more than two hours daily for learning, so we should:
                <ul>
                    <li>define the features that might be more desirable;</li>
                    <li>define some of the most often learning process pain points;</li>                
                </ul>
                <strong>Based on that we must prioritize the findings in order to shorten the learning curve for mastering the tool.</strong></li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  The users are positive that will have interest in lessons related to driving regulations and road signs, and find video and audio recording useful.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  As expected, the device preferences tend to be mobile-first experience, followed by desktop devices. Based on that data, the main focus should be on the user experience on a mobile device.<br>
                  <em><strong>**Competitive study shows that out of six similar tools, only two have apps available, so well designed and developed app could give an additional advantage of the tool.</strong></em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Most of the users would prefer both reading and video lessons.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Most of the users define such toll as very helpful.</li>
